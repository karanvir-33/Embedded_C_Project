# Embedded_C_Project
C code for hardware and software interfacing projects

## Overview
This repository contains the C code I developed as part of my Hardware and Software Interfacing (HSI) course at Seneca Polytechnic College, Ontario. The projects involve interfacing embedded systems with hardware components, including designing and developing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using Eagle Software and interfacing with a LabJack U3 device through C programming in Visual Studio IDE.

## Projects
### 1. **Temperature Monitoring System**
This project continuously monitors temperature using a temperature sensor. When the temperature exceeds a user-defined threshold, an alert system triggers with visual and sound notifications.

**Features:**
- Monitors temperature in real-time.
- Alerts when temperature exceeds a set threshold.
- Visual (LED) and sound (buzzer) alerts.

## Requirements
- **LabJack U3 device** for hardware interfacing.
- **Eagle Software** for PCB design.
- **Visual Studio IDE** for programming in C.

## Code Overview
The code is written in C and utilizes LabJack functions to interface with the hardware. The temperature sensor data is collected, and when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, the system triggers the alert systemm.
